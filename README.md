### Getting started

Use git or the download button (on the top left) to download the source code. If you want to see the actual progress go to the "main" branch. To open a >= ES6 module script you need to run your script from a local server, open directly the file with a browser will not work. I suggest you download [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) npm package. If you're coding on Visual Studio Code just install the extension and open `index.html` with live-server.
