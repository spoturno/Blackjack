    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
      Players are each dealt two cards, individually facing up or down depending
      on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two
      cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other
      countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards
      two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack,
      Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A
      hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw
      additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11
      is called "soft", meaning that the hand will be guaranteed to not score
      more than 21 by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will
      become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is
      called "hard". Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the
      dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have
      either exceeded the total of 21 or received blackjacks. The dealer then
      reveals the hidden card and must draw cards, one by one, until the cards
      total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stop. (At
      most tables the dealer also hits on a "soft" 17, i.e. a hand containing an
      ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players bet on the basis
      that they will individually have better hands than the dealer. The better
      hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without
      exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.</li>
          <li>If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.</li>
          <li>If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not, the player wins.</li>
          <li>If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust, the player wins.</li>
          <li>If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, this will be called a "push" and no one wins.</li>
        </ul>
